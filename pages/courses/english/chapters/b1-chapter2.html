            <h3>Common Expressions for Making Suggestions</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Let's...</strong> - "Let's go to the cinema tonight."</li>
                <li><strong>How about...?</strong> - "How about trying that new restaurant?"</li>
                <li><strong>Why don't we/you...?</strong> - "Why don't we meet earlier?"</li>
                <li><strong>We could...</strong> - "We could visit your parents this weekend."</li>

                <li><strong>Have you thought about...?</strong> - "Have you thought about joining a gym?"</li>
                <li><strong>It might be a good idea to...</strong> - "It might be a good idea to book in advance."</li>
                <li><strong>If I were you, I'd...</strong> - "If I were you, I'd speak to the manager."</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Responding to Suggestions</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Accepting:</strong> "That sounds good.", "Great idea!", "Why not?", "I'm up for that."</li>
                <li><strong>Rejecting politely:</strong> "I'd rather not.", "I'm not sure about that.", "I don't think that would work because...", "Maybe another time."</li>
