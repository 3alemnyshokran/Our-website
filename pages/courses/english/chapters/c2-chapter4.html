            <h2>C2 Chapter 4: Advanced Pragmatics and Sociolinguistics</h2>
            <p>At the C2 level, you can understand with ease virtually everything heard or read. You can summarize information from different spoken and written sources, reconstructing arguments and accounts in a coherent presentation. You can express yourself spontaneously, very fluently and precisely, differentiating finer shades of meaning even in more complex situations.</p>
            
            <div class="content-section">
                <h3>Pragmatic Competence</h3>
                <p>C2 level users demonstrate sophisticated pragmatic awareness:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Implied meaning and presupposition</strong>: Understanding what is meant but not explicitly stated</li>
                    <li><strong>Speech acts</strong>: Mastering indirect requests, subtle complaints, delicate refusals</li>
                    <li><strong>Cooperative principle</strong>: Knowing when and how to flout conversational maxims for effect</li>
                    <li><strong>Politeness strategies</strong>: Using elaborate negative politeness ("I was wondering if you might possibly consider...")</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>Sociolinguistic Awareness</h3>
                <p>At C2 level, you should be able to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Switch between dialects, accents, and regional varieties</li>
                    <li>Understand and use slang, colloquialisms, and jargon appropriately</li>
                    <li>Recognize language change and contemporary usage trends</li>
                    <li>Navigate sensitive topics with appropriate language choices</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Practice Questions</h3>
                <div class="question">
                    <p>1. What is the implied meaning in this exchange?<br>
                    A: "Are you going to the meeting?"<br>
                    B: "Well, I've got a deadline to meet."</p>
                    <p><strong>Answer:</strong> B is indirectly saying no, implying that the deadline takes priority and prevents attendance at the meeting.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="question">
                    <p>2. Rewrite this direct request as a more sophisticated indirect request suitable for a formal context: "Give me the report by Friday."</p>
                    <p><strong>Answer:</strong> I was wondering if it might be possible for you to submit the report by Friday, if that wouldn't be too inconvenient.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="question">
                    <p>3. How would you explain the difference between these two sentences in terms of register?<br>
                    a) "The committee has reached a decision on the matter."<br>
                    b) "They've figured out what to do about that thing."</p>
                    <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Sentence (a) uses formal register with precise vocabulary ("committee," "reached a decision," "matter"), while sentence (b) uses informal register with casual phrasing ("figured out," "that thing") and contractions.</p>
