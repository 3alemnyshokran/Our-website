            <h2>C2 Chapter 1: Mastering Nuance and Advanced Rhetoric</h2>
            <p>At the C2 level, you can understand with ease virtually everything heard or read. You can summarize information from different spoken and written sources, reconstructing arguments and accounts in a coherent presentation. You can express yourself spontaneously, very fluently and precisely, differentiating finer shades of meaning even in more complex situations.</p>
            
            <div class="content-section">
                <h3>Rhetorical Devices and Stylistic Features</h3>
                <p>At C2 level, you should be able to recognize and use advanced rhetorical devices:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Parallelism</strong>: "Ask not what your country can do for you; ask what you can do for your country." (John F. Kennedy)</li>
                    <li><strong>Anaphora</strong>: The repetition of a word or phrase at the beginning of successive clauses. "We shall fight on the beaches, we shall fight on the landing grounds, we shall fight in the fields..." (Winston Churchill)</li>
                    <li><strong>Hyperbole</strong>: Exaggeration for emphasis. "I've told you a million times."</li>
                    <li><strong>Litotes</strong>: Understatement, typically employing a double negative. "That's not insignificant."</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>Nuanced Expression</h3>
                <p>C2 speakers can express subtle distinctions in meaning, sentiment, and tone:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Using precise adjectives to convey subtle differences: "irritated" vs. "exasperated" vs. "incensed"</li>
                    <li>Employing modal expressions to convey precise degrees of certainty: "He must have been delayed" vs. "He might well have been delayed"</li>
                    <li>Using sophisticated hedging language: "It would appear that," "One might reasonably conclude that"</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="practice-section">
                <h3>Practice Questions</h3>
                <div class="question">
                    <p>1. Identify the rhetorical device in this sentence: "It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness."</p>
                    <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Parallelism and antithesis</p>
                </div>
                <div class="question">
                    <p>2. Replace the underlined words with more nuanced expressions: "The criticism made the author <u>very angry</u> and the review was <u>very bad</u>."</p>
                    <p><strong>Answer:</strong> The criticism left the author incensed/outraged/indignant and the review was scathing/excoriating/devastating.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="question">
                    <p>3. Rewrite this sentence using sophisticated hedging language: "I think the government's policy will fail."</p>
                    <p><strong>Answer:</strong> It would appear that the government's policy might well be destined to fall short of its intended objectives.</p>
