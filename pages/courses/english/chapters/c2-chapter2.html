            <h2>C2 Chapter 2: Academic and Professional Discourse</h2>
            <p>At the C2 level, you can understand with ease virtually everything heard or read. You can summarize information from different spoken and written sources, reconstructing arguments and accounts in a coherent presentation. You can express yourself spontaneously, very fluently and precisely, differentiating finer shades of meaning even in more complex situations.</p>

                <h3>Academic Writing Conventions</h3>
                <p>C2 level users can navigate complex academic conventions:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Hedging and cautious language</strong>: "Research suggests that...", "It appears that...", "The evidence tends to indicate..."</li>
                    <li><strong>Critical evaluation</strong>: "While X argues convincingly that..., the evidence presented fails to account for..."</li>
                    <li><strong>Cohesion and coherence markers</strong>: "Notwithstanding the aforementioned limitations...", "In light of these considerations..."</li>
                    <li><strong>Objective stance and impersonal structures</strong>: "It can be observed that..." instead of "I can see that..."</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>Professional and Technical Language</h3>
                <p>At C2 level, you should be able to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Use field-specific terminology with precision</li>
                    <li>Employ nominalization for formal effect: "The implementation of the strategy" instead of "implementing the strategy"</li>
                    <li>Structure complex arguments with subordination: "The proposal, which was initially rejected by the board on the grounds that it lacked sufficient evidence of feasibility, has subsequently been approved following a comprehensive review."</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Practice Questions</h3>
                <div class="question">
                    <p>1. Rewrite this sentence using appropriate academic language: "I think this theory is wrong because it doesn't match the facts."</p>
                    <p><strong>Answer:</strong> This theory appears to be inconsistent with the empirical evidence, suggesting that its fundamental premises may require reconsideration.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="question">
                    <p>2. Convert this informal sentence to a more formal, professional one: "We looked at the sales figures and found they went down last quarter."</p>
                    <p><strong>Answer:</strong> An analysis of the quarterly sales figures revealed a downward trend in the previous period.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="question">
                    <p>3. Identify the academic writing conventions used in this sentence: "While the research methodology appears robust, the sample size raises questions about the generalizability of the findings."</p>
                    <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Hedging language ("appears robust"), critical evaluation, academic vocabulary ("methodology," "generalizability")</p>
