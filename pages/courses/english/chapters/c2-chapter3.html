            <h2>C2 Chapter 3: Literary Analysis and Cultural References</h2>
            <p>At the C2 level, you can understand with ease virtually everything heard or read. You can summarize information from different spoken and written sources, reconstructing arguments and accounts in a coherent presentation. You can express yourself spontaneously, very fluently and precisely, differentiating finer shades of meaning even in more complex situations.</p>

                <h3>Literary Devices and Interpretation</h3>
                <p>C2 level users can recognize and analyze sophisticated literary techniques:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Allusion</strong>: References to historical, mythological, or literary figures/events. "She's my Achilles' heel."</li>
                    <li><strong>Symbolism</strong>: Using objects, characters, or colors to represent abstract ideas. "The green light at the end of Daisy's dock in The Great Gatsby symbolizes Gatsby's hopes and dreams."</li>
                    <li><strong>Irony</strong>: The expression of meaning using language that normally signifies the opposite. "The fire station burned down."</li>
                    <li><strong>Stream of consciousness</strong>: Writing that aims to portray a character's thought process. James Joyce's Ulysses is famous for this technique.</li>
                </ul>
