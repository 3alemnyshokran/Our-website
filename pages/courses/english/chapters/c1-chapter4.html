                correctAnswer: false,
                explanation: "Hedging language in academic discourse reflects appropriate scientific caution and precision rather than weakness. It acknowledges the limitations of evidence and avoids overgeneralizing findings."

                explanation: "Research hypotheses specify variables that can be measured, avoid value judgments like 'too much,' define the population precisely, and propose specific relationships that can be tested."

                question: "In academic discourse, the term '_____ fallacy' refers to the error of assuming that because something happened after something else, it must have been caused by it.",
                correctAnswer: "post hoc",
                explanation: "The 'post hoc' fallacy (from 'post hoc, ergo propter hoc' meaning 'after this, therefore because of this') involves mistakenly inferring causation from mere temporal sequence."

                question: "When analyzing data from different cultural contexts, it is generally more rigorous to apply standardized metrics without adaptation to ensure objective comparison.",
                correctAnswer: false,
                explanation: "Rigorous cross-cultural research often requires adapting metrics to ensure they are culturally appropriate and valid in each context, rather than assuming standardized measures developed in one culture apply universally."

                options: [
                    "Using the most complex vocabulary possible to impress readers",
                    "Making bold, absolute claims without acknowledging limitations",
                    "Structuring arguments logically, using precise terminology appropriate to the discipline, and acknowledging complexity and limitations",

                ],
                correctAnswer: 2,
                explanation: "Sophisticated academic writing prioritizes clarity, precision, and logical structure over unnecessarily complex vocabulary, acknowledges limitations rather than making absolute claims, and offers original analysis."

                explanation: "Academic analysis avoids simplistic value judgments like 'worse,' acknowledges complexity and variation across contexts, specifies what is meant by general terms like 'technology' and 'society,' and considers multiple perspectives."

                ],
                correctAnswer: 2,

                explanation: "'Cohesion' in discourse analysis refers to the linguistic features that connect ideas across a text, while 'coherence' refers to the logical relationships between ideas that may not be explicitly marked."

                ],
                correctAnswer: 1,
                explanation: "Intellectual humility involves recognizing the limits of one's knowledge and being open to revision based on new evidence, while still making well-reasoned claimsâ€”not avoiding claims altogether or deferring uncritically to others."

                explanation: "Methodologically sound comparative analysis specifies dimensions of comparison, avoids overgeneralizations like 'totally different,' acknowledges internal variation within categories, and considers factors that may complicate simple binary comparisons."
